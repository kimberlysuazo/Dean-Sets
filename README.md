Dean Sets is a Rails 5/React app based on the card game, [SET](http://www.setgame.com/set).

From the official [SET](http://www.setgame.com/set) game website:
SET is a game of fast-thinking fun! A SET is three cards where, for each feature all three cards in the proposed set are either all the same OR all different. Each card contains four features: color (red, purple or green), shape (oval, squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or outlined).
